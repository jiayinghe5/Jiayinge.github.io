I joined the faculty of the Business School at WPI in July 2020. I received my Ph.D. in Business Administration with an emphasis on marketing from West Virginia University. In my research I focus on studying how consumers make financial and health-related decisions, what biases they have when making those decisions, and what can the government and public policy makers do to protect them against harmful marketing practices. My research has been published in the Journal of Consumer Association, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, and the International Journal of Marketing and Business Communication. I have presented my work at several national and international conferences including Marketing and Public Policy, Society for Consumer Research, Society for Marketing Advances, and the Institute for the Study of Business Markets conferences.
